Advanced Minimal Operating System Simulation

Project Overview: This project presents a simulation of a minimal operating system that integrates advanced features such as process scheduling, memory management, and system call handling. The implementation leverages a graphical user interface (GUI) for seamless user interaction, enabling inputs like process arrival times, burst times, priority levels, and memory allocation parameters. The simulation serves as an educational tool for comprehending foundational operating system concepts.
